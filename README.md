Final project for ADS-504-01-SU2023

Access to safe drinking water is essential to health, a basic human right, and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional, and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit since the reductions in adverse health effects and healthcare costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.

The dataset consists of water quality metrics for 3276 different water bodies. The target variable, water potability, indicates if water is safe for human consumption, where 1 means potable and 0 means not potable. The predictor variables consist of pH values, Hardness, Solids (Total dissolved solids - TDS), Chloramines, Sulfates, Conductivity, Organic Carbon, Trihalomethanes & Turbidity.
